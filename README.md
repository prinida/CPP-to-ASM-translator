# C++ to assembler translator

This project intended for translation (conversation) subset of **C++** language to **assembler** program.

## Supported subset of C++ language 
+ data type **int** (at the moment only positive numbers are supported)
+ variable description instructions
+ assignment operators **=**, **if**, **if-else** of any nesting and in any sequence
+ operations **+, â€“, \*, ==, !=, <**

## Brief description of the work

**Phases of translation:**
1. Lexical analysis
2. Syntax analysis (parsing)
3. Assembler code generation

Lexical analysis - the work is based on a **finite state machine**.\
The parser is implemented using the **LL(1)** table method.\
Assembler code generator uses postfix notation.

## Project structure

+ *examples* folder contains examples with resources in *res* folder, *results* folder with *assembler.txt* and *postfix.txt* or *errors.txt* files, exe file to run program ourselves.

+ *res* folder contains resources required for the translator to work:
  + *alphabet.txt* - contains all symbols in language
  + *keywords.txt* - contains all keywords in language
  + *operators.txt* - contains all operators in language
  + *operatorsOperandsNumber.txt* - contains the number of operands for operators and keywords
  + *parseTable.txt* - contains parse table intended for syntax analysis
  + *priorities.txt* - contains operator and keyword priorities
  + **program.txt** - contains source program on **C++** language
  + *separators.txt* - contains all separators in language

+ *src* folder contains all source code files("*.h", "*.cpp")

+ *CMakeLists.txt* contains code on cmake language to build project

Also *results* folder that generated after executation *exe* file contains:
+ *assembler.txt* - contains assembler program to run on **MASM** (generated if the program is successfully executed)
+ *postfix.txt* - contains postfix notation of program (generated if the program is successfully executed)
+ *errors.txt* - contains syntax and lexical errors (generated in case of program execution failure)

## Build solution with CMake on Windows

*You need install cmake on your machine to build solution.*

1. Create folder for solution (for example *build* folder in repository folder) using the command `mkdir build`
2. Go to the *build* folder `cd build`
3. Use this command `cmake -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" ..` to generate project and needed cmake files in *build* folder. You can use other compilers instead of "Visual Studio 17 2022", detailed list of compilers you can observe after entering command `cmake --help` in section "Generators"
4. To build project you need enter command `cmake --build .` or use your integrated development environment(IDE) or use selected compiler
5. *exe* file located in path "build\bin\Debug\"
6. The results of the program can be found in the *results* folder

## Simple example

**More complex examples can be found in the folder *examples*.**

**Source program** (located in *res* folder in *program.txt* file):

``` cpp
int main()
{
    int g = 11 * 20;
    
    if (g == 11 * 20 + 1 - 1)
    {
        int b = 15 - 14;
    }
    else
    {
        int a = 172;
    }
	

    return 0;
}
```

**Postfix notation** (located in *results* folder in *postfix.txt* file):
```
g 11 20 * = int g 11 20 * 1 + 1 - == m1 if b 15 14 - = int m2 else m1: a 172 = int m2: 0 return [int main()] 
```

**Assembler code** (located in *results* folder in *assembler.txt* file):
```asm
